## Auto-detect CJS deps with export maps

The Vite plugin now pre-bundles CJS dependencies that ship an `exports` field (e.g. `use-sync-external-store` pulled in by Base UI), including their deep imports. The manual `optimizeDeps.include` workaround and the direct `use-sync-external-store` dependency are no longer needed.
